# SelaGroup

Home assigment from Sela Group

## Getting Started

* Clone project locally as `git clone https://github.com/jasper22/SelaGroup.git`. 
* Restore dependencies
    * Enter \Sela-Server folder and run `dotnet restore` to restore .NET Core packages
    * Enter \Sela-client folder and run `npm install` to restore NPM pakcages

### Prerequisites

I actually did it with .NET Core version 3.0.100-preview6-012264. You can download it here: [Microsoft .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) but I guess any version will do it. There's nothing special about this version in this application.
Angular core version 8

### Installing

Start \Sela-Server and \Sela-client to start the application.

1. Enter \Sela-server folder and run `dotnet run`
2. Enter \Sela-cleint folder and run `ng serve`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to actually see the application

Tip: To login any username/password combination will do
